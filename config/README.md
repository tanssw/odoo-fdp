# Odoo Configuration Files

## On Initial Setup

This directory should notcontain `odoo.conf` file. You should start setting up from the Odoo web interface, and the configuration file will be generated automatically.

## After Initial Setup

Once the `odoo.conf` file is generated, you can copy the additional content from `odoo.conf.example` to `odoo.conf` as needed. Make sure to adjust the settings according to your requirements.
